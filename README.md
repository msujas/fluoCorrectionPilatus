a script for manual subtraction of fluorescence signal for a Pilatus detector.

Use: in the fluoCorrection.py script input the average_gainCorrected cbf image and the poni file for the experiment, then choose a scale factor for the fluorescence, this subtracts a background which is the scale factor multiplied by the solid angle of each pixel (calculated with pyFAI) (maximum normalised). Look at the fluoCorr 2d integrated image in Fiewer, and iteratively adjust the scale factor until it looks like it's been properly subtracted: judge by the azimuthal intensity distribution which should be similar to the background sample.
